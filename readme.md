--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Mad Libs*** is a **phrasal template word game** created by *Leonard Stern* and *Roger Price*.

The game is frequently played as a party game or as a pastime. It consists of one player prompting others for a list of words to substitute for blanks in a story before reading aloud.

Mad Libs books contain short stories on each page with many key words replaced with blanks. Beneath each blank is specified a category, such as "noun", "verb", "place", "celebrity," "exclamation",etc. One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute a word of the specified type for each blank, but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud. 

The result is usually a sentence which is comical, surreal and/or takes on somewhat of a nonsensical tone.

Stern and Price's original Mad Libs book gives the following sentence as an example:
"_____! *(exclamation)* he said _____ *(adverb)* as he jumped into his convertible _____ *(noun)* and drove off with his _____ *(adj.)* wife."

After completion, they demonstrate the sentence:
"**Ouch!** he said **stupidly** as he jumped into his convertible **car** and drove off with his **brave** wife."
